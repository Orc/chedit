Since I've not found one to my liking, I've ported a font-editor of
mine over to Linux.  This is a moderately ancient editor -- it is
ported from a Atari ST font editor that I wrote in the late 1980s,
and is based on a UCSD Pascal font editor that was written in the
late 1970s.  This version is designed to work only with psf-style
fonts (one of the formats that setfont is able to read.)

The source, in case you're interested, is written in the same style
as the original UCSD code -- cryptic and almost comment-free. But,
unlike the original code, it's actually somewhat readable; I dug the 
editor out of my archives and ported it to Linux in about 8 hours
while waiting for a collection of database jobs to finish.

The editor can be found at

    ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/Incoming/chedit.tar.gz,

hopefully soon to move to

    ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Keyboards/chedit.tar.gz

where it can live alongside the fonts it can edit.
