Chedit is an incredibly inflexible character set editor for psf-style
bitmap 8x16 fonts for VGA consoles.  It is ported from an Atari ST
font editor of the same name, which was inspired by the original
Chedit for USCD Pascal.

The source is written in the spirit of Chedit on the Terak 8510a, for those
of you into random historia, and, in keeping with its history, is written
with a fairly odd style and almost no documentation.

The original README from the atari ST distribution is included, for
amusement value.
