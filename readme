Chedit is an incredibly inflexible character set editor for degas-style
monochrome 8x16 fonts.  It only works on standard (not Moniterm) monochrome
moniter-equipped STs (It may work on a STe, but it's never been tested.)
The source is written in the spirit of Chedit on the Terak 8510a, for those
of you into random historia, and, in keeping with its history, is written
with a fairly odd style and almost no documentation.

Despite all this, it is a useful tool for modifying fonts.  If you don't
have Degas, or want a tool that is designed for working on fonts, this
will do the trick for you.  I've released it into the public domain, so
you may do with it as you will.
